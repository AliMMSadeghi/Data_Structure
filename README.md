# Data Structures Training Repository

This repository contains essential code files and examples for practicing and mastering basic data structures. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for anyone looking to improve their understanding and skills in data structures, whether for academic purposes, technical interviews, or personal development.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of the following basic data structures:
- **Arrays**: Examples of static and dynamic arrays, common operations, and usage.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists with basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).
- **Stacks**: Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, along with common stack operations.
- **Queues**: Queue implementation using arrays and linked lists, including variations like circular queues.
- **Trees**: Basic tree structures like binary trees and binary search trees, with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- **Graphs**: Representation of graphs using adjacency lists and matrices, and fundamental graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS).

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine and use the files to study and practice various data structures. The code files are organized by data structure type, making it easy to navigate and focus on one concept at a time.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AliMMSadeghi/Data_Structure.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd Data_Structure
